# Stock Price Prediction Project

In this workshop project, we built a complete stock price prediction system using three different AI models. The project covered the full pipeline from **data preparation** to **model evaluation**, showcasing practical applications of machine learning in finance.  

## Key Concepts & Tools

- **Data Preparation:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Models:**  
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR) – Scikit-Learn  
  - Random Forest – Scikit-Learn  
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) – TensorFlow  
- **Results Evaluation:** Matplotlib
